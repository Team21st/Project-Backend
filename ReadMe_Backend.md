Inorder to run the backend project that I submitted. Please read the text below:



### jar
you will find a jar called: "CS353project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" under the "target" file.

I have copy a jar in the index, you could use it to run the jar 

### environment 

Since I have deployed most of the third-party middleware I need to use on my own server, and my server address has been written in my project, in theory, I don't need to install more things, but I can run it through the jar package played by Maven



### run the jar

1. linux

   * Enter the directory where the jar file is stored
   * enter the commandï¼š java -jar CS353project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
   * check whether the program is start or not

2. windows

   * Win + R, enter CMD to open the command line

   * After entering "Java", drag the jar package in directly

   * just as below
